## READY FOR THE ANXIETY?
The Anxiety is a 1.17.1 adventure map, full of places to explore, where you need to collect all artifacts in order to save the kingdom once and for all...
Your help is needed! [Download the map now!]()

## Features
- [] hours of gameplay!
- Own custom resource pack!
  - Custom mobs, items, and soundtrack!

## Installation
### Map
Download [this file](), extract/unzip it and drag the containing folder called "§l§4THE ANXIETY" into your saves folder which you can access by
- Windows: Press `⊞ Win` + `R` (or open "Run"), copy `%appdata%/.minecraft/saves` into the text field and press enter.
- Mac: Press `⌘ Command`+ `⇧ Shift` + `G` (or open "Finder"), press `⌘ Command` + `Space` (or press "Spotlight"), copy `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves` into the text field and press enter.

**Make sure that the file is extracted/unzipped and the "§l§4THE ANXIETY" folder is directly in the saves folder.**

### Resource Pack
For the full experience (and some things in the map actually making sense), we highly recommend to download our resource pack for
- Custom mobs
- Custom items and models
- Custom soundtrack

Download [this file]() and drag it into your resource pack folder (in-game options - Resource Packs - Open Pack Folder). You don't need to extract it. Reload the menu by re-entering it and clicking the arrow when hovering over the resource pack called "**THE ANXIETY - Resource Pack**" to move it to the right hand side of the screen. Click "Done".

### OptiFine
In order for the resource pack to fully function, FPS boost, and dynamic lighting, you need to install OptiFine for 1.17.1 [here](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.17.1_HD_U_H1.jar). After you executed the downloaded file, you can find a new profile in your Minecraft launcher, which you need to start (before that, you need to start the vanilla 1.17.1 release as well, which you can find under the "New installations" tab).
