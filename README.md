Download [this file]() and drag it into your resource pack folder (in-game options - Resource Packs - Open Pack Folder). You don't need to extract it.

### OptiFine 
In order for the resource pack to fully function, FPS boost, and dynamic lighting, you need to install OptiFine for 1.17.1 [here](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.17.1_HD_U_H1.jar). After you executed the downloaded file, you can find a new profile in your Minecraft launcher, which you need to start (before that, you need to start the vanilla 1.17.1 release as well, which you can find under the "New installations" tab).
